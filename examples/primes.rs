/*

This example shows how the algorithm works using some simple numbers.

Assume that you have two equations:

    12 = 2 * 6
    6 = 3 * 2

If you arrange these equations as a tree,
you will naturally start at the top `12` and list
children of each node in the same order as in the equations.

When using an automated theorem prover that re-writes
a tree like this, it can get messy.
Some algorithms relies on a well-ordered tree to perform efficiently.

By performing topological sort on the tree,
it can be restored to a well-ordered form:

    Tree            i       i'
    --------------------------
    12              3   =>  0
    |- 2            2   =>  1
    |- 6            1   =>  2
       |- 3         4   =>  3
       |- 2         0   =>  4

The algorithm does not change the connections inside the tree,
just how nodes are stored in memory.
